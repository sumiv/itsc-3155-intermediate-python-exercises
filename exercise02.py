# Write a function that takes in two dict data structures as input. 
# Both dicts map str->int (the keys are strings and the values are integers). 
# The function should compute a new dict which combines the two dicts by summing the values for the common keys. 
# Keys that are not common should be left out. Use the following code to test your function, 
# but remember that your function should for all str->int dict inputs, not just the test here.
